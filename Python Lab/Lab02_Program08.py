# Write a program to find the roots of a quadratic equation when the coefficients a, b and c are given ( assume that a, b and c are integers)
# Hint: find the discriminant d= b2 âˆ’ 4ac
# If d = 0, the equation has one real repeated root (both roots are the same: 
# R1= R2 = -b/(2a)
# If d > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots.
# 	R1= (-b + sqrt(d))/2a
# R2= (-b - sqrt(d))/2a
# If d < 0, the equation has two complex roots.
# real_part = -b / (2 * a) 
# imaginary_part = math.sqrt(-discriminant) / (2 * a)
